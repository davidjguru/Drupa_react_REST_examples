This Project Is an Example of Using Drupal 8 Core Rest and REACT js framework

To get started Install A Fresh Copy of Drupal 8 (currently 8.4X) with the standerd profile.

Clone This Repo:

Move the 2 Modules in the QuickStartModule
to /modules/custom folder

then back in this repo run:
npm install
and npm start

you will then be taken to the example app which will guide you through configuring settings

which is easy basicly install 3 contrib modules,
then install the react_clean module and the react_rest_quick_start module included in this repo
(which set all permissions and settings for you ...your welcome !)

(There is a patch for the file_entity module but it is easy to do.)

Then just open src/config/Config.js and change the "baceUrl" to your drupal site.

Then Enjoy
